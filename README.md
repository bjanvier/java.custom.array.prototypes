# SIMILAR JS ARRAY PROTOTYPES IN JAVA

Java Array Lists libraries have all the methods needed to manipulate arrays; However, because anyone can create theirs, so did I this morning.

* With the help of JAVA Object() class and custom generic types, the `ArrayJSPrototype` class in here will have methods that does similar tasks an array would, such as pushing new items, removing items, popping the last element, splicing, to only name a few. I am going to add the rest of the methods such `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `slice`, `copyWithin`, etc.
* Also, this class will provide the flexibilty to have `ANY` type similar to `TypeScript`
*
